This file includes every usecase (in use, or planned) for Sbotga, for every intent.

# Sbotga
Sbotga is a Discord bot based around the popular rhythm game "HATSUNE MIKU: COLORFUL STAGE" or "Project Sekai". It provides minigames, information, and help around the game.

Some of its more popular features include minigames (such as guessing), viewing the game's "charts" or "maps" (to study and play better), or viewing their progress in the game visually by generating an image. However, Sbotga has a lot more features for basically every niche in the game.

The name, "Sbotga", is a variation of the popular "meme" in the community, known as "Sbuga".

## Message Content Intent
Sbotga includes a guessing minigame, a main feature of the bot. A cropped image (or otherwise modified, such as grayscale) is sent, and the user must determine what the image is referring to.

For example, a song's jacket is cropped and sent, and the user must determine which song it is by name.

Currently, to guess, users must ping the bot and use the format of `@Sbotga ANSWER` to guess. Pinging the bot is slow, hard on mobile, and causes people to ping other people accidentally.

Message Content Intents would be used to replace the guess format with `-ANSWER` instead, making it faster to guess.
