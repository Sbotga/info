This file includes every usecase (in use, or planned) for Sbotga, for every intent.

# Message Content Intent
Sbotga includes a guessing minigame, a main feature of the bot. A cropped image (or otherwise modified, such as grayscale) is sent, and the user must determine what the image is referring to.

For example, a song's jacket is cropped and sent, and the user must determine which song it is by name.

Currently, to guess, users must ping the bot and use the format of `@Sbotga ANSWER` to guess. Pinging the bot is slow, hard on mobile, and causes people to ping other people accidentally.

Message Content Intents would be used to replace the guess format with `-ANSWER` instead, making it faster to guess.
