# Account Linking and Transferring
Sbotga relies on account linking and transferring to provide some of its services.

# Account Linking
### What is it?
Account linking is used to verify and save your corresponding PJSK user ID to a Discord account. This allows us to identify your PJSK account. Verification is done via your PJSK bio (`Comment`) and is all public information.
### How-To
Run `/pjsk user link`. This guide is in progress, and more info will be added soon.
### Benefits
- In leaderboards (ranked and event), Sbotga will add a check mark next to your account so you know where you are.
- In ranked and event view, not specifying anything will cause Sbotga to search for your account in t100.
- Allows account transferring.
